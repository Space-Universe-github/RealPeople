                This exposé brings attention to <span class="highlight">@Symfiz</span>, who has admitted to liking feral porn, raising serious concerns about possible zoophile behavior. This information was brought to my attention by a reliable source.
            </p>

            <h2 class="post-subheading">Key Allegations</h2>
            <ul class="post-list">
                <li><strong>Admission:</strong> Symfiz has publicly stated that he “likes feral porn” and defends it by saying, “it’s just fictional.”</li>
                <li><strong>Association:</strong> Symfiz is connected to a known pedophile who has claimed that calling out such behavior constitutes “stalking.”</li>
                <li><strong>Content Warning:</strong> The attached screenshots contain censored references to feral porn, but trigger warnings (TW) are necessary due to the nature of the content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="post-subheading">Evidence</h2>
            <p>Full screenshots are available that confirm Symfiz’s statements. Symfiz’s AD account is public, making it easy to verify his following of feral artists and engagement with related content.</p>
