            <h2 class="post-subheading">Key Allegations</h2>

                <li><strong>Admission:</strong> Symfiz has publicly stated that he “likes feral porn” and defends it by saying, “it’s just fictional.”</li>
                <li><strong>Association:</strong> Symfiz is connected to a known pedophile who has claimed that calling out such behavior constitutes “stalking.”</li>
                <li><strong>Content Warning:</strong> The attached screenshots contain censored references to feral porn, but trigger warnings (TW) are necessary due to the nature of the content.</li>
            </ul>
